- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    Jessie W

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    None this week

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    I wish I knew more about data structures. It would make it a lot easier. I like Java though and I can't wait til I dont have to look up every single little thing I do

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    Programming is simmiliar between languages. Knowing python definetly makes java easier. Learning one is kind of like building a tool kit. As you develop your knowledge of what is possible, you can be more creative & build more awesome things.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    What worked was W3 schools and what didn't work was understanding the difference between an ArrayList and an Array.
    My advice would be to look up the Math package & to look up "how to use dictionary in Java" and to not worry too much if you don't fully understand each data structure youre using.
